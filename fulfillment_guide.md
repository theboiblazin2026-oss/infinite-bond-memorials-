# Manual Fulfillment SOP: Snipcart -> Printful

**Objective**: Safely process customer orders from your website (Snipcart) to your Print-on-Demand provider (e.g., Printful) with a quality control check.

## Prerequisites

* Access to [Snipcart Dashboard](https://app.snipcart.com/dashboard)
* Access to [Printful Dashboard](https://www.printful.com/dashboard) (or your chosen POD provider)
* A folder on your desktop named `Customer Uploads`

## Step-by-Step Workflow

### 1. Receive Order Notification

You will receive an email from Snipcart with the subject `New Order #SNIP-XXXX`.

* **Action**: Open the email and click **View Order** to go to the Snipcart dashboard.

### 2. Review Order Details within Snipcart

In the Snipcart Order view, look at the **Items** section.

* **Check Custom Fields**: You will see fields like `Photo`, `Name`, `Dates`.
* **Action**: Click the **Download link** next to the customer's uploaded photo.
* **Save**: Save the file to your `Customer Uploads` folder using the naming convention: `OrderNumber_CustomerName_Product.jpg` (e.g., `SNIP1024_Smith_Blanket.jpg`).

### 3. Quality Control (QC) Check

**STOP and Verify**:

* Is the photo blurry? (Zoom in to 100%)
* Is the face cut off?
* Is the text spelled correctly (matched against the order notes)?
* *If there is an issue*: Email the customer immediately to request a better photo or clarification. **Do not print bad files.**

### 4. Create Order in POD Dashboard (e.g., Printful)

* Log in to Printful.
* Click **New Order** -> **Basic Order**.
* **Select Product**: Choose the blank product matching what the customer bought (e.g., "Gildan 64000 T-Shirt - Black - L").
* **Upload Design**:
  * Upload the customer's photo from your desktop.
  * Add any text layers if you are designing in the editor, OR upload the finished design file if you prepared it in Canva/Photoshop first.
* **Shipping Info**: Copy/Paste the customer's Name and Address *exactly* from Snipcart.
* **Shipping Method**: Select the shipping speed matching what the customer paid for (Standard vs. Express).

### 5. Submit & Pay

* Review the mockups one last time.
* Pay the base cost to the POD provider (you keep the profit margin collected in Snipcart).
* **Submit to Fulfillment**.

### 6. Mark as Shipped

Once the POD provider ships the item (usually 2-5 days later), they will give you a **Tracking Number**.

* Go back to **Snipcart**.
* Find the order.
* Click **Mark as Shipped**.
* Paste the **Tracking Number** and Carrier (e.g., USPS, UPS).
* Snipcart will automatically email the customer their tracking info.

## Troubleshooting

* **Customer wants a refund?**: Go to Snipcart -> Orders -> Select Order -> Refund. Then go to Printful and cancel the order if it hasn't printed yet.
* **Order stuck in "Processing"?**: Check if the POD provider is out of stock of that specific size/color. You may need to email the customer to offer an alternative.
